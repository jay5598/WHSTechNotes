My idea for an Ai project is to use it for reasturants or fast foods.
I choses those 2 things because somtimes the people taking the order be forgetting what you order than they have you waiting a while just to get your food.
The reason why I said this because it happened to me and my mom when we went to go get something to eat. We order are food then they tolds to wait at the third window but they kept coming out with people food that had waited only a few minutes while we was waiting for 25 minutes. Then when they came it had to fresh because the food was cold but they were nice to bring us deserts for the long wait and extra fresh food.

It presents an advanced future for jobs, offering both promising opportunities and potential pitfalls. The concept of earning real wages from virtual labor, such as restocking shelves or assisting customers within a digital environment. This invention introduces a novel dimension to the employment landscape. This invention could democratize access to work allowing individuals with physical limitations or those in remote areas to participate in the workforce, thereby expanding economic inclusion.
